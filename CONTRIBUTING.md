# Contributing to Sif

## Rules

- We love pull requests but, given the early stage of the project, we love discussions too! If you have an idea, open an issue and pitch your next cool feature :)
- Use feature branches. **Create an issue for every single feature or bug** and **label** it. If you are a core contributor, create a branch named feature/[issue #] to resolve the issue. If you are not a core contributor, fork and branch.
- Try to label issues and PRs as accurately as possible, especially in the case of PRs, where `semver-major`, `semver-minor` and `semver-patch` labels are available. Labels on issues should be a subset of the labels on the corresponding pull request; the milestones should match.
- Use github "Fixes #[issue]" syntax on your PRs to indicate which issues you are attempting to resolve
- Keep Sif small. If some piece of functionality can fit in a separate `sif-*` module, then it probably should

## Sign-off your Commits

We encourage contributors to "sign-off" on their commits:

```bash
$ git commit -s -m "Some commit message"
```

This will append the following to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

This sign-off certifies that you have the rights to submit your work under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) and that you agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](http://developercertificate.org/):
